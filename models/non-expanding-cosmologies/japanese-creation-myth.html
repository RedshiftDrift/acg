      Common Elements in Creation Myths</a><br>
    <hr>
    <h1>Japanese Creation Myth</h1>
    Long ago all the elements were mixed together with one germ of life.
    This germ began to mix things around and around until the heavier
    part sank and the lighter part rose. A muddy sea that covered the
    entire earth was created. From this ocean grew a green shoot. It
    grew and grew until it reached the clouds and there it was
    tranformed into a god. Soon this god grew lonely and it began to
    create other gods. The last two gods it made, Izanagi anf Izanami,
    were the most remarkable.
    <p>One day as they were walking along they looked down on the ocean
      and wondered what was beneath it. Izanagi thrust his staff into
      the waters and as he pulled it back up some clumps of mud fell
      back into the sea. They began to harden and grow until they became
      the islands of Japan. </p>
    <p>The two descended to these islands and began to explore, each
      going in different directions. They created all kinds of plants.
      When they met again they decided to marry and have children to
      inhabit the land. The first child Izanami bore was a girl of
      radiant beauty. The gods decided she was too beautiful to live in
      Japan, so they put her up in the sky and she became the sun. Their
      second daughter, Tsuki-yami, became the moon and their third and
      unruly son, Sosano-wo, was sentenced to the sea, where he creates
      storms. </p>
    <p>Later, their first child, Amaterasu, bore a son who became the
      emperor of Japan and all the emperors since then have claimed
      descent from him. </p>
