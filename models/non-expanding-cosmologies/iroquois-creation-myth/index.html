    <h1>Iroquois Creation Myth</h1>
    Long before the world was created there was an island, floating in
    the sky, upon which the Sky People lived. They lived quietly and
    happily. No one ever died or was born or experienced sadness.
    However one day one of the Sky Women realized she was going to give
    birth to twins. She told her husband, who flew into a rage. In the
    center of the island there was a tree which gave light to the entire
    island since the sun hadn't been created yet. He tore up this tree,
    creating a huge hole in the middle of the island. Curiously, the
    woman peered into the hole. Far below she could see the waters that
    covered the earth. At that moment her husband pushed her. She fell
    through the hole, tumbling towards the waters below.
    <p>Water animals already existed on the earth, so far below the
      floating island two birds saw the Sky Woman fall. Just before she
      reached the waters they caught her on their backs and brought her
      to the other animals. Determined to help the woman they dove into
      the water to get mud from the bottom of the seas. One after
      another the animals tried and failed. Finally, Little Toad tried
      and when he reappeared his mouth was full of mud. The animals took
      it and spread it on the back of Big Turtle. The mud began to grow
      and grow and grow until it became the size of North America. </p>

    <p>Then the woman stepped onto the land. She sprinkled dust into the
      air and created stars. Then she created the moon and sun. </p>
    <p>The Sky Woman gave birth to twin sons. She named one Sapling. He
      grew to be kind and gentle. She named the other Flint and his
      heart was as cold as his name. They grew quickly and began filling
      the earth with their creations. </p>
    <p>Sapling created what is good. He made animals that are useful to
      humans. He made rivers that went two ways and into these he put
      fish without bones. He made plants that people could eat easily.
      If he was able to do all the work himself there would be no
      suffering. </p>
    <p>Flint destroyed much of Sapling's work and created all that is
      bad. He made the rivers flow only in one direction. He put bones
      in fish and thorns on berry bushes. He created winter, but Sapling
      gave it life so that it could move to give way to Spring. He
      created monsters which his brother drove beneath the Earth. </p>
    <p>Eventually Sapling and Flint decided to fight till one conquered
      the other. Neither was able to win at first, but finally Flint was
      beaten. Because he was a god Flint could not die, so he was forced
      to live on Big Turtle's back. Occasionally his anger is felt in
      the form of a volcano. </p>
    <p>The Iroquois people hold a great respect for all animals. This is
      mirrored in their creation myth by the role the animals play.
      Without the animals' help the Sky Woman may have sunk to the
      bottom of the sea and earth may not have been created. </p>
