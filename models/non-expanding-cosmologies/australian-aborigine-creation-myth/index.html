    <h1>Australian Aborigine Creation Myth</h1>
    There was a time when everything was still. All the spirits of the
    earth were asleep - or almost all. The great Father of All Spirits
    was the only one awake. Gently he awoke the Sun Mother. As she
    opened her eyes a warm ray of light spread out towards the sleeping
    earth. The Father of All Spirits said to the Sun Mother,
    <p>"Mother, I have work for you. Go down to the Earth and awake the
      sleeping spirits. Give them forms." </p>
    <p>The Sun Mother glided down to Earth, which was bare at the time
      and began to walk in all directions and everywhere she walked
      plants grew. After returning to the field where she had begun her
      work the Mother rested, well pleased with herself. The Father of
      All Spirits came and saw her work, but instructed her to go into
      the caves and wake the spirits. </p>
    <p>This time she ventured into the dark caves on the mountainsides.
      The bright light that radiated from her awoke the spirits and
      after she left insects of all kinds flew out of the caves. The Sun
      Mother sat down and watched the glorious sight of her insects
      mingling with her flowers. However once again the Father urged her
      on. </p>
    <p>The Mother ventured into a very deep cave, spreading her light
      around her. Her heat melted the ice and the rivers and streams of
      the world were created. Then she created fish and small snakes,
      lizards and frogs. Next she awoke the spirits of the birds and
      animals and they burst into the sunshine in a glorious array of
      colors. Seeing this the Father of All Spirits was pleased with the
      Sun Mother's work. </p>
    <p>She called all her creatures to her and instructed them to enjoy
      the wealth of the earth and to live peacefully with one another.
      Then she rose into the sky and became the sun. </p>

    <p>The living creatures watched the Sun in awe as she crept across
      the sky, towards the west. However when she finally sunk beneath
      the horizon they were panic-stricken, thinking she had deserted
      them. All night they stood frozen in their places, thinking that
      the end of time had come. After what seemed to them like a
      lifetime the Sun Mother peeked her head above the horizon in the
      East. The earth's children learned to expect her coming and going
      and were no longer afraid. </p>
    <p>At first the children lived together peacefully, but eventually
      envy crept into their hearts. They began to argue. The Sun Mother
      was forced to come down from her home in the sky to mediate their
      bickering. She gave each creature the power to change their form
      to whatever they chose. However she was not pleased with the end
      result. The rats she had made had changed into bats; there were
      giant lizards and fish with blue tongues and feet. However the
      oddest of the new animals was an animal with a bill like a duck,
      teeth for chewing, a tail like a beavers and the ability to lay
      egg. It was called the platypus. </p>
    <p>The Sun Mother looked down upon the Earth and thought to herself
      that she must create new creatures less the Father of All Spirits
      be angered by what she now saw. She gave birth to two children.
      The god was the Morning Star and the goddess was the moon. Two
      children were born to them and these she sent to Earth. They
      became our ancestors. She made them superior to the animals
      because they had part of her mind and would never want to change
      their shape. </p>
