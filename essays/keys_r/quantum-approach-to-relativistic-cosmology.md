# [A Quantum Approach to Relativistic Cosmology](./quantum-approach-to-relativistic-cosmology.pdf)
**By Roy Keys** - 2022 October 19

Cosmology is the branch of astrophysics concerned with the large-scale structure of the cosmos and (in the current interpretation) the origin of the universe. Yet science seeks to explain the world from a principle of conservation. If the universe had a beginning, then matter and motion, space and time, had to be created. This point of view is obviously incompatible with a principle of conservation. An alternative model is proposed to circumvent these difficulties, and an extension of general relativity theory is posited.
