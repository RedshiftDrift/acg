            &nbsp; Just trying to look at the questionnaire from a
            purely descriptive standpoint I would say this paragraph
            characterizes the agreements:<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; “Most of us agree that the universe is not expanding,
            has no age and never went through an epoch of high density
            and temperature—in other words, that the Big Bang never
            happened. Most of us also agree that the redshift
            relationship is produced by something that happen to the
            light as it travels—some tired light process-- and that the
            helium, deuterium and lithium observed in old stars was
            produced by thermonuclear reactions in stars and by cosmic
            rays. The&nbsp; forces of gravity and electromagnetism,
            combined with thermonuclear reactions, have shaped the
            structures we see from stars to super-clusters. We don’t see
            the necessity for an epoch of matter-antimatter equality
            since the universe was never both hot and dense. Without
            expansion and the other hypotheses of LCDM there is no need
            for dark energy either.”<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; I DO NOT want to create an Anti-Concordance
            Cosmology, so I want to emphasize that we don’t all agree on
            the above paragraph. But most of us seem to, and that is, in
            my view, a long way from everyone having their own personal
            model.<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            &nbsp; It appears that we do have considerable disagreements
            on the origin of the CMB and the phenomena that LCDM labels
            dark matter as well as on the nature of quasars (if that
            last one is really needed for a coherent history of the
            cosmos.)<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; This is my attempt at an objective take on the
            results of the questionnaire—just treating ourselves as the
            observed phenomena.<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            Questionnaire and answers by ACG members:<br>
            <br>
            1) Did the universe go through an epoch of high density and
            temperature?<br>
            - Yes (ΛCDM)<br>

            - No, except perhaps the local universe (OS)<br>
            <br>
            2) Is the universe expanding?<br>
            - Yes (ΛCDM)<br>
            - Yes, the universe evolution is cyclic. The universe is
            expanding at this epoch (VV)<br>
            - No (LM, PB, EL, CF, AK, HC, BR, DR, OS, YHS)<br>
            - No, but bubbles within are expanding (AT, RF)<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            3) How old is the universe?<br>
            - 12.6 Gy to 13.8 Gy (ΛCDM)<br>

            by ΛCDM (AK)<br>
            - local universe: 6 - 14 Gy; whole universe: no age,
            eternal, not-known eternal time (OS)<br>

            Z-pinches (RF)<br>
            - overall abundances remain constant at all observable

            - universe: many Big Bangs far away, there are so many of
            them eternally everywhere (OS)<br>
            <br>
            6) What process thermalized and isotropized the CMB
            radiation? Where was the CMB produced?<br>
            - Thomson scattering; everywhere at decoupling z=1089 (ΛCDM)<br>
            - interstellar medium (HC)<br>
            - universe: in the Big Bangs (OS)<br>
            - everywhere, ongoing, source undetermined (RF)<br>
            - nearly thermodynamic equilibrium in IGM - gas (CF)<br>

            - Thomson scattering by electrons and solar wind particles
            inside earth's magnetosphere; local (DS)<br>
            - very long redshifts and inverse Compton scattering traffic
            jam at ~218GHz, ongoing; ISM and IGM (AT)<br>
            - ambient temperature produced by thermodynamic equilibrium
            of IGM and ISM non-luminous matter with the ambient
            electromagnetic radiation of the cosmos; ISM and IGM,
            ongoing (BR, DR, VV)<br>
            <br>
            7) What process created the structures that we see from

            - space expansion (ΛCDM, VV)<br>
            - 4D universe (OS)<br>
            - some type of tired light (EL, CF, LM, DR, DS, YHS)<br>
            - small positive curvature of universe removes energy from
            photons in transit (HC)<br>
            - relativistic gravitational effect and absorption effect on
            spherical wavefronts of light (BR)<br>
            - photons are a kind of slightly dissipative solitons
            (details), cannot be nondissipative particles in any case
            (AK)<br>
            - orbiting matter (stars, dust...) for the proper redshift;
            bubble expansion for all galaxies; for far away light:
            crossing many expanding bubbles (AT, PB)<br>
            - a repulsive force between electrically neutral matter that
            is part of an electrically neutral Maxwell force that is
            needed to explain inertia and the speed of light limit of
            neutral objects (RF)<br>
            <br>
            9) What process produced more observed matter than
            antimatter?<br>
            - CP violation, a small asymmetry in quark/anti-quark decay
            rates (ΛCDM)<br>
            - maybe a futile question (OS)<br>
            - the universe was not created, there is no need to have an
            equal amount (LM, PB, HC, BR, DR)<br>
            - asymmetric baryogenesis for unknown process in prequark
            "black" energy (AT)<br>
            - it is possible that the correction of ΛCDM will imply a
            correction of standard model (CF)<br>
            - particle creation process automatically, dynamically,
            gives rise to only one kind of matter (AK, RF)<br>
            - separation of matter and antimatter by
            magnetic/gravitational processes at very large scales (EL)<br>
            &nbsp;<br>
            10) Are quasars at the distance indicated by their redshift?<br>
            - Yes (ΛCDM, VV)<br>
            - some of them might be other BBs (OS)<br>
            - No, closer than estimated by ΛCDM (LM, BR, DR, RF, DS, PB,
            OS)<br>
            - No, farther than estimated by ΛCDM (AT, OS)<br>
            - At least a significant fraction of them (YHS)<br>
            - Yes, but their luminosity gets diminished by
            hyperspherical lensing (HC)<br>
            <br>
            11) What process produces quasars?<br>
            - active galaxies powered by billion-solar-mass black holes
            (ΛCDM, CF, AT, HC, OS)<br>
            - undetermined (RF)<br>
            - Arp's theory - baby galaxies spit out by SMBH (DR)<br>
            - plasmoids contained by magnetic fields, gravity involved
            as well (EL, OS)<br>
            - active galaxies with not completely certain details of
            power source (AK, OS)<br>
            - very big explosion of black holes and galaxies, where
            everything starts again (OS)<br>
            - active galaxies seen through hydrogen clouds, spectra
            dipole-redshifted by hydrogen (LM, OS)<br>
            - quasars are nascent galaxies gestated by full scale active
            galaxies; the observed outcome of a gravitational collapse
            arrested before event horizon-singularity formation (BR, PB,
            OS)<br>
            <br>
            12) What process causes very distant objects (e.g. SN Type
            1a) to appear unusually faint?<br>
            - acceleration of expansion of universe (ΛCDM)<br>
            - undetermined (RF)<br>

            - hyperspherical lensing within a non-expanding universe
            (HC, OS)<br>
            - linear relation of z with distance, non-expanding universe
            (EL, OS)<br>
            - they are so far, and some of them are baby galaxies from
            the bangs (OS)<br>
            - this is not a model-independent observation;
            misinterpreted redshift measurements (LM, AT, DR, DS, PB,
            OS)<br>
            <br>
            13) What causes the gravity identified as dark matter?<br>
            - weakly interacting particles, non-baryonic matter (ΛCDM,
            OS)<br>
            - magnetic fields (EL, OS)<br>
            - needs a better theory (VV)<br>
            - General Relativity fails (DS)<br>
            - fully ionized ordinary matter (YHS)<br>
            - positive spacetime curvature of universe adds to rotation
            velocity (HC)<br>
            - misinterpreted redshift measurements, condensed matter
            (e.g. rocks) (LM, PB, DR, OS)<br>
            - lousy analytics, cannot expect a Keplerian decline in the
            rotation curves of galaxies (BR, AT, LM, PB, OS)<br>
            - lousy analytics, cannot treat galaxies as gravitational
            point sources in galactic clusters (BR, AT, OS)<br>
            - not gravity or matter, but unreduced chaotic motion and
            interaction processes neglected in usual description (AK)<br>
            - needs a better theory; different forces, not matter, more
            electromagnetic forces, unknown forces, we can postulate
            forces as well as matter (OS)<br>
            - a Lorentz force between electrically neutral matter that
            is part of an electrically neutral Maxwell force that is
            needed to explain inertia and the speed of light limit of
            neutral objects (RF)<br>
            <br>
            14) What is the energy identified as dark energy?<br>
            - cosmological constant (ΛCDM, OS)<br>
            - General Relativity fails (DS)<br>
            - misinterpreted redshift measurements (LM, BR, AT, PB, AK,
            DR, OS, YHS)<br>
            - not an energy at all, hyperspherical lensing within a
            non-expanding universe (HC)<br>
            - misinterpreted measurement, absorption of light by
            intergalactic medium does not need dark energy (VV)<br>
            - needs a better theory; different forces, not matter, more
            electromagnetic forces, unknown forces, we can postulate
            forces as well as matter (OS)<br>
            - a repulsive force between electrically neutral matter that
            is part of an electrically neutral Maxwell force that is
            needed to explain inertia and the speed of light limit of
            neutral objects (RF)<br>
