## CCC-I
Moncao, Portugal June 23-25

Astrophysicists gather to discuss new challenges and alternatives to the Big Bang

The past year has brought more and more data from the cosmos that challenge the predictions of the Big Bang, the
dominant theory of cosmology. Increasing numbers of astronomers are thinking that the field has entered a crisis. To look
at the new data, examine the difficulties facing the Big Bang and to discuss entirely different views of the universe and its
history, including those without a Big Bang, some three dozen astrophysicists will converge on the village of Moncao,
Portugal for the First Crisis In Cosmology Conference June 23-25.
