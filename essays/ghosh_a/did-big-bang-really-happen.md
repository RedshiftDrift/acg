# [Did ‘Big Bang’ Really Happen?](./did-big-bang-really-happen.pdf)

The basic nature of the universe--finite and evolving as a whole or infinite and
quasi-static--is still not fully established, although mainstream scientists have
accepted the standard 'Big Bang' model. Only a small group of people continues
to struggle against this dogma, seeking to replace the standard model with an
infinite quasi-static universe. Considerable discussion takes place in specialized
workshops and meetings, but unfortunately, this group has not been successful
in its quest to see the standard model discarded. This group consists of persons
who are not professional scientists, but also recognized, trained professional
astrophysicists and cosmologists.
