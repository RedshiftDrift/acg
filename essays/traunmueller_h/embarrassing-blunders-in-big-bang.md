In Big Bang cosmology, the universe expanded from a very dense, hot and opaque initial state. It became transparent when it had expanded for 380,000 years and cooled to about 3000 kelvins. At this stage, light was last scattered by elementary particles and released. The light waves were then further stretched by the expansion of the universe. They are now, 13.7 billion years later, about 1100 times longer. This is thought to have resulted in the observable thermal radiation with 2.7 kelvins – the cosmic microwave background (CMB).

But how can we even see this radiation if the matter of which we consist shares its origin with the light?
