    The term «metaphysics» has certainly been badly mistreated
    in the last few decades (centuries?), and has come to
    designate the lot of all types of weirdness, off-this-world
    and wacky ideas. As such, the entire discipline tends to be
    ridiculed and dismissed by scientists as useless and
    unintelligible nonsense, the makings of wild and unbridled
    imaginations, fruitless and endless arguing, akin to
    enquiries about the afterlife, spiritism, extra sensorial
    perception, numerology, astrology, the sex of angels and how
    many of them can fit on the top of a needle.<br>
    <br>
    In my opinion, R.G. Collingwood did a pretty good job at
    straightening things out in «Essay on Metaphysics» [1],
    although one can wonder if science (or anyone, for that
    matter) even bothered to take note. If I have not totally
    wasted my time reading, what I retain is that <b>
      metaphysics is the discipline that studies absolute
      presuppositions through cultures and history</b>.<br>
    <br>
    As defined by Collingwood, absolute presuppositions are
    concepts that:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>cannot be proven or disproven </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>have one and only one opposite which is its negation,
        and which also cannot be proven or disproven</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>about which no question can reasonably be asked</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>can only be propounded</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li>in the case where more than one is propounded, are
        consupponible (complete without resulting from) among a
        set of absolute presuppositions</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    Anyone who (still) views metaphysics as the arena of
    intellectual wanking is probably violating one or many of
    the above rules that define absolute presuppositions.
    Endless debates among otherwise intelligent people, that see
    no possible hope of outcome or settlement, is a good
    indication that maybe questions are being asked about some
    absolute presupposition, or that attempts are being made at
    proving or disproving some absolute presupposition.<br>
    <br>
    Whether scientists like it or not, a set of absolute
    presuppositions underlie, orient and to some extent govern
    all science and how science is done. Whatever is their
    endeavour, enquiry or accomplishment, scientists,
    consciously or not, whether they will admit it or not,
    necessarily made a prior assumption of one or its opposite
    of each absolute presupposition that makes up the set of
    absolute presuppositions underlying their discipline.
    Newton’s « Hypotheses non fingo » was hiding a secret
    mistress.<br>
    <br>
    Although I can in no way pretend to be a metaphysicist
    myself, what I did next is an attempt at a list of absolute
    presuppositions that specifically apply to modern physics,
    and more specifically to cosmology:<br>
    <blockquote>1)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Infinity</b>: The universe is
      spatially and temporally infinite.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>2)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Conservation</b>: Matter or
      energy cannot be created or destroyed.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Isotropy</b>: On a
      sufficiently large spatial and temporal scale, the
      universe appears the same at all locations, in all
      directions, and at all times (cosmological principle).<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Causality</b>: every event
      has a cause. <br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>5)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Rationality</b>: there exists
      an intrinsic coherence, elegance, logic and purpose in all
      of nature's processes and entities.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6)&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Subjectification</b>:
      physically real entities are defined by measurements, but
      measurements alone do not necessarily define physical
      reality.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    Examples of predictions from theories that are widely
    accepted today as scientifically valid, will show which
    metaphysical choices underlie modern physics:<br>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Age of the universe</u>: thinking of the universe
        as having an «age» implies that the universe did not
        exist at some point in time. The concept of «age», when
        applied to the universe, is contrary to the absolute
        presupposition of «<b>Infinity</b>» (temporal).</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Black Holes</u>: objects that are surrounded by an
        «event horizon» singularity beyond which time and space
        interchange one another, that have no inside, and at the
        center of which exists a punctual mass of infinite
        density are absurdities. This is contrary to the «<b>Rationality</b>»
        absolute presupposition.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Big Bang</u>: according to the theory, the universe
        was denser in the distant past. This is contrary to the
        «<b>Isotropy</b>» absolute presupposition.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Big Bang event</u>: the theory posits that
        everything that exists in the universe suddenly
        appeared, forcibly, out of nowhere, and suddenly started
        expanding at a rate incoherent with the known laws of
        nature, and for no purported reason. This is contrary to
        the «<b>Conservation</b>» and the «<b>Causality</b>»
        absolute presuppositions. </li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Quantum fluctuations</u>: the occurrence of
        particle-antiparticle pairs spontaneously popping into
        existence and vanishing into the void is contrary to the
        «<b>Conservation</b>» and the «<b>Causality</b>»
        absolute presupposition.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Superposition of states</u>: the idea that cats can
        at the same time be dead and alive is an absurdity, and
        contravenes to the «<b>Rationality</b>» absolute
        presupposition.</li>
    </ul>
    <ul>
      <li><u>Spacetime curvature</u>: the object defined by
        measurements of distances as “space”, and the object
        defined by measurements of durations as “time”, combine
        to form a third object, “spacetime”, with properties of
        being stretchable, squeezable and bendable. This is
        contrary to the absolute presupposition of “<b>Subjectification</b>”.</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    There are more examples. But these are sufficient to
    determine which absolute presuppositions are assumed in
    modern physics:<br>
    <blockquote>1.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Finity</b>: the universe is
      both spatially and temporally finite. It has a beginning,
      therefore an age, and a size, i.e.: a spatial limit beyond
      which nothing exists, not even space, and a temporal limit
      before which time did not exist.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>2.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Non-conservation</b>:
      matter/energy can spontaneously be created, and can be
      annihilated.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>3.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Anisotropy</b>: the average
      density of the universe, on very large spatial and
      temporal scales, varies with time, and is not the same at
      all distances.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>4.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Acausality</b>: events may
      have no cause.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>5.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Absurdity</b>: objects with
      absurd properties may exist and absurd events may happen
      in physical reality.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>6.&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>Objectification</b>: whatever
      can be measured or inferred from measurements is a
      physical reality.<br>
    </blockquote>
    <br>
    It is my humble opinion that there is reason to critically
    examine science's actual metaphysical choices, and ponder on
    whether or not these choices are commendable, and if the
    results and implications of said choices are desirable.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    There is no getting around the fact that metaphysical
    choices (assumptions of absolute presuppositions) orient the
    way science is done. For example, astrophysics are, as I
    write, looking for new star formation theories and alternate
    galaxy dynamics (new physics) to explain XMM-2599 [2],
    because of their prior assumption that durations superior to
    13.8 billion years are not permitted. With a metaphysical
    choice of temporal “Infinity”, the addition of a few
    trillion years to the “age of the universe” makes the
    existence of XMM-2599 no longer a mystery. General
    relativity led to black holes; quantum mechanics led to
    alternate realities; galaxy rotation curves led to dark
    matter; supernovae brightness-distance relationships led to
    accelerated expansion of space and to dark energy; and so
    on. The mathematical prediction of absurdities or the
    empirical observation of unexplained phenomena should lead
    further research in the direction of realistic science, and
    not towards the objectification of imaginary concepts and
    the easy way out of “new physics” that have no hope of ever
    being falsified, such as dark energy, virtual particles,
    superior dimensions, stretching space, or alternate
    universes, as if any of these could ever be considered
    physical realities.<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    Given these metaphysical choices, scientists nowadays act as
    if they had lost the ability to distinguish between the
    absurd and common sense, with blessings from the Copenhagen
    Interpretation. And as long as such a mentality prevails,
    physics, and science in general will keep loosing
    credibility among the general public, now in an increasing
    struggle (pop-science writers not helping) to make sense out
    of things that intrinsically don’t (“What was before the Big
    Bang?”; “What does space expand into?”; “Could the Big Bang
    be the result of two universes colliding with each other?”).
    Such a trend can easily be taken to a logical and extremely
    dangerous outcome: if the rising popularity of flat-earthism
    can be considered harmless, the anti vaccine movement, on
    its part, has already made fatal victims, not to mention
    possible long-term outcomes of climato-scepticism. Believers
    want to believe. If faith in science is lost, the masses
    will turn their beliefs towards political or religious
    precepts, with their irrationality and dogmas, and where
    history relates massacres by the millions in the name of
    imaginary authorities.<br>

    A critical examination of mainstream physics is more
    important than it seems!<br>
