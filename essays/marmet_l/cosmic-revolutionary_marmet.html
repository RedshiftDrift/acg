    <br>
    &nbsp; This handbook is an introduction to cosmology,
    similar to other books that have been written in the
    field.&nbsp; But it has the added twist of some hint at a
    Cosmological Revolution!&nbsp; Australian astronomers Barnes
    and Lewis write an acrimonious rebuttal to <i>‘spherical’</i>
    ignorants who think they can revolutionize cosmology without
    learning physics or astronomy.&nbsp; Indeed, there are
    hundreds of crackpots who continually waste everybody's time
    on worthless ideas.&nbsp; The authors' advice to the
    revolutionary?&nbsp; <i>Learn physics and publish your
      revolutionary idea in refereed journals.</i><br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Few cosmologists will want to admit this, but the Big
    Bang model is in desperate need of a revolution.&nbsp;
    Serious crises are threatening modern cosmology, starting
    with the Hubble tension which exposes an inconsistency on
    the most fundamental assumption of expansion
    cosmology!&nbsp; Then comes the lithium problem, the
    sigma-eight tension, mature galaxies seen too early after
    the Big Bang, <i>‘cosmologists would dump the dark
      components in a moment’</i>, <i>‘the physics of inflation
      is poorly understood’</i>, and the Big Bang model does not
    even pass the criteria of the twelve <i>‘Theoretical
      Values’</i> listed in the book...<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; So yes, pleeeease, put the Big Bang out of its own
    misery and let's have a revolution!<br>
    <br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Here is the problem: behind this revolutionary book
    hides two astrophysicists who don't want real change. This
    is obvious from the unrealistic expectations they have for a
    potential revolutionary theory.&nbsp; The new theory must
    explain <i>all astronomical observations</i>, and it must
    have <i>‘survived testing by new experiments and new data’.</i>
    &nbsp;
    Never in history have revolutionary theories satisfied these
    criteria.&nbsp; Barnes and Lewis, like most cosmologists,
    only want to take small steps.&nbsp; They think that <i>‘a
      small correction to our ideas’</i> can be enough, or that
    <i>‘a small change will naturally and neatly explain’</i>
    unresolved issues.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Playing it safe by changing a few parameters,
    tweaking general relativity or adding a few more particles
    won't be enough: the Big Bang model needs a real paradigm
    shift comparable in magnitude to the <i>Copernican
      Revolution</i>.&nbsp; If you are a real revolutionary, you
    will have done your homework, you will have learned physics
    and you will know your enemy.&nbsp; If you are a real
    revolutionary, you won't learn much from this book.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; Real revolutions are messy. "A new scientific truth
    does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them
    see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually
    die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it"
    declared Max Planck.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp; So watch out mates, a rival will fall: Big Bang
    cosmology. "Science progresses one funeral at a time", <i>
      for 'tis the sport to have the cosmologist hoist with his
      own petard!</i> <br>
