            <br>
            &nbsp; This handbook is an introduction to cosmology,
            similar to other books that have been written in the
            field.&nbsp; But it has the added twist of some hint at a
            Cosmological Revolution!&nbsp; Australian astronomers Barnes
            and Lewis write an acrimonious rebuttal to <i>‘spherical’</i>
            ignorants who think they can revolutionize cosmology without
            learning physics or astronomy.&nbsp; Indeed, there are
            hundreds of crackpots who continually waste everybody's time
            on worthless ideas.&nbsp; The authors' advice to the
            revolutionary?&nbsp; <i>Learn physics and publish your
              revolutionary idea in refereed journals.</i><br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Few cosmologists will want to admit this, but the Big
            Bang model is in desperate need of a revolution.&nbsp;
            Serious crises are threatening modern cosmology, starting
            with the Hubble tension which exposes an inconsistency on
            the most fundamental assumption of expansion
            cosmology!&nbsp; Then comes the lithium problem, the
            sigma-eight tension, mature galaxies seen too early after
            the Big Bang, <i>‘cosmologists would dump the dark
              components in a moment’</i>, <i>‘the physics of inflation
              is poorly understood’</i>, and the Big Bang model does not
            even pass the criteria of the twelve <i>‘Theoretical
              Values’</i> listed in the book...<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; So yes, pleeeease, put the Big Bang out of its own
            misery and let's have a revolution!<br>
            <br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Here is the problem: behind this revolutionary book
            hides two astrophysicists who don't want real change. This
            is obvious from the unrealistic expectations they have for a
            potential revolutionary theory.&nbsp; The new theory must
            explain <i>all astronomical observations</i>, and it must
            have <i>‘survived testing by new experiments and new data’</i>.&nbsp;






            Never in history have revolutionary theories satisfied these
            criteria.&nbsp; Barnes and Lewis, like most cosmologists,
            only want to take small steps.&nbsp; They think that <i>‘a
              small correction to our ideas’</i> can be enough, or that
            <i>‘a small change will naturally and neatly explain’</i>
            unresolved issues.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Playing it safe by changing a few parameters,
            tweaking general relativity or adding a few more particles
            won't be enough: the Big Bang model needs a real paradigm
            shift comparable in magnitude to the <i>Copernican
              Revolution</i>.&nbsp; If you are a real revolutionary, you
            will have done your homework, you will have learned physics
            and you will know your enemy.&nbsp; If you are a real
            revolutionary, you won't learn much from this book.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; Real revolutions are messy. "A new scientific truth
            does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them
            see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually
            die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it"
            declared Max Planck.<br>
            <br>
            &nbsp; So watch out mates, a rival will fall: Big Bang
            cosmology. "Science progresses one funeral at a time", <i>
              for 'tis the sport to have the cosmologist hoist with his
              own petard!</i> <br>
