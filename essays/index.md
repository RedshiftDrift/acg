# Essays on cosmology

Comments on the Big Bang model, the scientific method, the cosmologists, philosophy, etc.

## [New Thermodynamics: Inelastic Collisions and Cosmology](https://doi.org/10.24018/ejphysics.2020.2.6.32)
By Kent W. Mayhew - 2020 December 1

The sciences have evolved around elastic collisions although most collisions are inelastic.  Inelastic collisions create photons.  This has led to consideration of an ensemble of inelastic collisions producing CMB.  This will further lead to brief discussions concerning the nature of dark matter, and dark energy.

## [Book Review: The Cosmic Revolutionary's Handbook](https://cosmology.info/essays/cosmic-revolutionary_marmet.html)
By Louis Marmet - 2020 August 24

Few cosmologists will want to admit this, but the Big Bang model is in desperate need of a revolution.  The Hubble tension exposes an inconsistency on the most fundamental assumption of expansion cosmology!

## [What I Learned by Reading Collingwood](https://cosmology.info/essays/what-i-learned-reading-collingwood_berrigan.html)
By Pierre Berrigan - 2020 February 27

  The term «metaphysics» has certainly been badly mistreated in the last few decades and has come to designate the lot of all types of weirdness, off-this-world and wacky ideas. As such, the entire discipline tends to be ridiculed and dismissed by scientists as useless and unintelligible nonsense, the makings of wild and unbridled imaginations, fruitless and endless arguing.

## [Cosmology Questions to ACG Members](https://cosmology.info/essays/cosmology-questions_lerner.html)
By Eric Lerner - 2020 January 29

  Trying to look at the questionnaire from a purely descriptive standpoint I would say this paragraph characterizes the agreements.

## [The Scientific Evidence Against the Big Bang](https://lppfusion.com/science/cosmic-connection/plasma-cosmology/the-growing-case-against-the-big-bang/)
By Eric Lerner - 2020 January 19

  The contradictions between Big Bang theory predictions and observations are not at all limited to those that have been widely dubbed a “Crisis in Cosmology”.  Despite the continuing popularity of the theory, essentially every prediction of the Big Bang theory has been increasingly contradicted by better and better data.  The real crisis in cosmology is that the Big Bang never happened.

## [A Philosophical Rejection of the Big Bang Theory](https://zenodo.org/record/3544779#.Xd1s25MzbIU)
By Khuram Rafique - 2018

In this book, original papers of Friedmann, Lemaître, Hubble, Einstein along with others have been analyzed and only the most fundamental aspects like expansion and CMBR of the Big Bang Cosmology are covered. If these two aspects of the Big Bang Cosmology are precisely refuted then there is nothing crucial left with the standard model.
