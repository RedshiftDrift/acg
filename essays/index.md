# Essays on cosmology

Comments on the Big Bang model, the scientific method, the cosmologists, philosophy, etc.

## [Tired-Light Redshift Models](https://cosmology.info/essays/tired-light-models_marmet.html)
By Louis Marmet - 2022 December 17

A collection of models proposed to explain the cosmological redshift in a non-expanding universe.

## [A Quantum Approach to Relativistic Cosmology](https://cosmology.info/essays/quantum-approach-to-relativistic-cosmology_keys.pdf)
By Roy Keys - 2022 October 19

Cosmology is the branch of astrophysics concerned with the large-scale structure of the cosmos and (in the current interpretation) the origin of the universe. Yet science seeks to explain the world from a principle of conservation. If the universe had a beginning, then matter and motion, space and time, had to be created. This point of view is obviously incompatible with a principle of conservation. An alternative model is proposed to circumvent these difficulties, and an extension of general relativity theory is posited.

## [New Thermodynamics: Inelastic Collisions and Cosmology](https://doi.org/10.24018/ejphysics.2020.2.6.32)
By Kent W. Mayhew - 2020 December 1

The sciences have evolved around elastic collisions although most collisions are inelastic.  Inelastic collisions create photons.  This has led to consideration of an ensemble of inelastic collisions producing CMB.  This will further lead to brief discussions concerning the nature of dark matter, and dark energy.

## [Book Review: The Cosmic Revolutionary's Handbook](https://cosmology.info/essays/cosmic-revolutionary_marmet.html)
By Louis Marmet - 2020 August 24

Few cosmologists will want to admit this, but the Big Bang model is in desperate need of a revolution.  The Hubble tension exposes an inconsistency on the most fundamental assumption of expansion cosmology!

## [Galaxies and Explosions in the Eternal Universe](https://cosmology.info/essays/galaxies-and-explosions-in-the-eternal-universe_santavuori.pdf)
By Olli Santavuori - 2020 April 7

The accelerating going away of the galaxies from the eyes of the observer happens because of the infinite – no edge – property of the universe. It does not mean the expansion of the space itself, as the Big Bang-theory concludes and supposes.

## [What I Learned by Reading Collingwood](https://cosmology.info/essays/what-i-learned-reading-collingwood_berrigan.html)
By Pierre Berrigan - 2020 February 27

  The term «metaphysics» has certainly been badly mistreated in the last few decades and has come to designate the lot of all types of weirdness, off-this-world and wacky ideas. As such, the entire discipline tends to be ridiculed and dismissed by scientists as useless and unintelligible nonsense, the makings of wild and unbridled imaginations, fruitless and endless arguing.

## [Cosmology Questions to ACG Members](https://cosmology.info/essays/cosmology-questions_lerner.html)
By Eric Lerner - 2020 January 29

  Trying to look at the questionnaire from a purely descriptive standpoint I would say this paragraph characterizes the agreements.

## [The Scientific Evidence Against the Big Bang](https://lppfusion.com/science/cosmic-connection/plasma-cosmology/the-growing-case-against-the-big-bang/)
By Eric Lerner - 2020 January 19

  The contradictions between Big Bang theory predictions and observations are not at all limited to those that have been widely dubbed a “Crisis in Cosmology”.  Despite the continuing popularity of the theory, essentially every prediction of the Big Bang theory has been increasingly contradicted by better and better data.  The real crisis in cosmology is that the Big Bang never happened.

## [Criteria for a Scientific Cosmological Model](https://cosmology.info/essays/criteria-for-a-scientific-model_marmet.html)
By Louis Marmet - 2019 December 13

The distinction between physics and mathematics should always be clear in the scientist's mind. Every physics concept is defined by a measuring device.

## [A Philosophical Rejection of the Big Bang Theory](https://zenodo.org/record/3544779#.Xd1s25MzbIU)
By Khuram Rafique - 2018

In this book, original papers of Friedmann, Lemaître, Hubble, Einstein along with others have been analyzed and only the most fundamental aspects like expansion and CMBR of the Big Bang Cosmology are covered. If these two aspects of the Big Bang Cosmology are precisely refuted then there is nothing crucial left with the standard model.

## [List of cosmological models and supporting papers](https://cosmology.info/essays/models_marmet.html)
By Louis Marmet - In progress

  List of contemporary cosmological models and supporting papers
